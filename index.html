<h3> WORKOUT </h3>
<p1> When people think about working out to lose weight, they often assume it means strenuous cardio and resistance training at the gym. But if you're not ready or able to commit to a gym membership you can still lose weight and build muscle in the comfort of your own home. If performed correctly and consistently, home workouts can be every bit as effective as a gym workout. The key is to focus on strength training. Building muscle through resistance exercises helps to boost lean mass. While you will want to eventually incorporate cardio into your workout, start by getting the basics correct. By seeing and feeling the results early on, you will be more likely to keep with the program over the long term.</p1>
